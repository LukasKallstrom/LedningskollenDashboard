# Dash Application

## Overview
This repository contains a Dash application designed to search and process data from an Excel file named "Lednings채gare.xlsx". The application specifically looks for data in the row labeled "Oms채ttning (tkr)" and provides a user-friendly interface to visualize and interact with this data.

All company names were collected from "[https://www.ledningskollen.se/Vilka-ar-med_](https://www.ledningskollen.se/Vilka-ar-med_)" and all revenue data was collected from "[Allabolag.se](https://www.allabolag.se/)", websites and data open to the public.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before running the application, ensure you have Docker installed on your machine. Visit [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/get-started) for installation instructions.

### Running the Application

1. **Build the Docker Image**

   Use the following command to build the Docker image for the Dash application:

   ```
   docker build -t dash-app .
   ```

2. **Run the Application**

   After building the image, run the application using the following command:

   ```
   docker run -p 4093:4093 dash-app
   ```

   This command will start the application and make it accessible at `http://localhost:4093`
   (feel free to change the port, but remember to change the port in both the dockerfile aswell as in this command)
